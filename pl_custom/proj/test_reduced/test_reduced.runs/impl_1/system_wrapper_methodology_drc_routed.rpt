The FDRE cell system_i/axis_data_fifo_0/inst/gen_fifo_generator.fifo_generator_inst/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X42Y75 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell system_i/axis_data_fifo_0/inst/gen_fifo_generator.fifo_generator_inst/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree
